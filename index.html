        <h2>Howrah Bridge</h2>
        <p>Howrah Bridge is a balanced cantilever bridge over the Hooghly River in West Bengal, India. Commissioned in
          1943,[8][10] the bridge was originally named the New Howrah Bridge, because it replaced a pontoon bridge at
          the same location linking the two cities of Howrah and Kolkata (Calcutta). On 14 June 1965 it was renamed
          Rabindra Setu after the great Bengali poet Rabindranath Tagore, who was the first Indian and Asian Nobel
          laureate.[10] It is still popularly known as the Howrah Bridge.</p>
